It charts one day 16th June 1904 in the lives of three inhabitants of Dublin- the advertising salesman Leopold Bloom, the artist Stephen Dedalus and Bloom 's wife Molly. Their peregrinations, thoughts and encounters form the basis of the narrative, which becomes a celebration of all human experience through the lives of specific individuals in a specific place at a specific time. Ulysses is both an experimental novel and a book intimately concerned with the events of modern life. A lively repository of literary allusion and colloquial realism, this dazzlingly innovative, ambitious novel is here presented in its 1939 Odyssey Press version, which is regarded as the most accurate text published in Joyce 's lifetime. This edition also includes over 9,000 notes by Joyce scholars Sam Slote, Marc A. Mamigonian and John Turner.",

Truly thrilling.\" --The New York Times More than twenty years after the publication of the groundbreaking The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman returns to that parallel world to expand on the story of Lyra, \"one of fantasy's most indelible characters.\" (The New York Times Magazine) Malcolm Polstead is the kind of boy who notices everything but is not much noticed himself. And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy.... Malcolm\'s parents run an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his daemon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue. He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust--and the spy it was intended for finds him. When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, he sees suspicious characters everywhere: the explorer Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; a gyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a daemon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl--just a baby--named Lyra. Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm. \"Too few things in our world are worth a seventeen year wait: The Book of Dust is one of them.\" --The Washington Post \"People will love the first volume of Philip Pullman's new trilogy with the same helpless vehemence that stole over them when The Golden Compass came out.\" --Slate",

Her cynical wit and worldly opinions start to rattle Strether's preconceived view of the situation. In Paris, Strether meets Chad and is impressed by the much greater sophistication Chad seems to have gained during his years in Europe. Chad takes him to a garden party, where Strether meets Marie de Vionnet, a lovely woman of impeccable manners, separated from her reportedly unpleasant husband, and Jeanne, her exquisite daughter. Strether is confused as to whether Chad is more attracted to the mother or the daughter. At the same time, Strether, himself, feels an overwhelming attraction to Marie de Vionnet, which he suspects she might requite, and so begins questioning his commitment to return to Woollett and marry Chad's mother, despite his admiration for her.",

What he finds is a vast territory of red hills and tortuous arroyos, American by law but Mexican and Indian in custom and belief. In the almost forty years that follow, Latour spreads his faith in the only way he knows--gently, all the while contending with an unforgiving landscape, derelict and sometimes openly rebellious priests, and his own loneliness. Out of these events, Cather gives us an indelible vision of life unfolding in a place where time itself seems suspended.

    description: "(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) Evelyn Waugh's most celebrated novel is a memory drama about the intense entanglement of the narrator, Charles Ryder, with a great Anglo-Catholic family. Written during World War II, the novel mourns the passing of the aristocratic world Waugh knew in his youth and vividly recalls the sensuous plea?sures denied him by wartime austerities; in so doing it also provides a profound study of the conflict between the demands of religion and the desires of the flesh. At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, \"Brideshead Revisited\" transcends Waugh's familiar satiric exploration of his cast of lords and ladies, Catholics and eccentrics, artists and misfits, revealing him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity. The edition reprinted here contains Waugh's revisions, made in 1959, and his preface to the revised edition.",

Lusty, violent, wildly funny, it is a rigadoon of rascality, a bawled-out comic song of sex.â (Dorothy Parker, Esquire) First published in Paris in 1955, and originally banned in the United States and Ireland, J. P. Donleavyâs debut novel has since been recognized around the world as the masterful portrait of a charming and shameless American abroad. Meet Sebastian Dangerfield: husband, father, and American law student at Trinity College in Dublin. Awaiting news of his fatherâs death and the substantial inheritance to follow, Sebastian barely has time for his studies as he chases women, avoids bill collectors, and tries to survive without having to descend into the bottomless pit of steady work. In the words of Sean OâReilly, âthis man has granted himself the appalling right to say and think whatever the hell he likes. Silver-tongued seducer, hoaxer, thief, violent marauder, fantasist and drunk, heâs a Yank into the bargain, the rank outsider and âgreat gasâ altogether. You cannot help yourself enjoying his outrageous companyâ (The Irish Times).",

    description: "#1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller An award-winning psychologist and director of the UCLA Center for Digital Behavior shows everyone how to make real, lasting change in their lives in this exciting work of popular psychology that goes beyond The Power of Habit with science and practical strategies that can alter their problem behaviorsâforever. Whether itâs absent-minded mistakes at work, a weakness for junk food, a smart phone addiction, or a lack of exercise, everyone has some bad habit or behavior that theyâd like to change. But wanting to change and actually doing itâand sticking with itâare two very different things. Dr. Sean Young, an authoritative new voice in the field of behavioral science, knows a great deal about our habitsâhow we make them and how we can break them. Stick with It is his fascinating look at the science of behavior, filled with crucial knowledge and practical advice to help everyone successfully alter their actions and improve their lives. As Dr. Young explains, you donât change behavior by changing the person, you do it by changing the process. Drawing on his own scientific research and that of other leading experts in the field, he explains why change can be difficult and identifies the crucial forces that combine to make transformation permanent, from the right way to create new habits to how to harness emotional meaning to motivate change. He also helps us understand how the mind often interferes with creating lasting change and how we can outsmart it, including using \"neurohacks\" to shortcut the brainâs counterproductive instincts. In addition he provides a powerful corrective to the decades old science of habits, offering a next generation discussion of how habits can change behavior with the right approach. Packed with pragmatic exercises and stories of real people who have used them successfully, Stick with It shows that it is possible to control spending, stick to a diet, become more social, exercise regularly, stop compulsively checking e-mail, and overcome problem behaviorsâforever.",

description: "I've long believed that market need and competency must have the catalyst of passion if a company is to have a competitive advantage. Omar Khan and Paul B. Brown practice what they preach and tear into the liberation of passion with raw gusto and exhilarating energy. Reading this book gives leaders the opportunity to improve the power of their assets several-fold without a penny of capital investment. If that doesn't impassion you, nothing will. Alan Weiss, Ph.D. Author, Million Dollar Consulting Finally, a solid business book with practical advice to produce life-changing and profit-making results. Liberating passion by strengthening relationships throughout an organization has been one of the most neglected areas in business literature. But no more! As the authors state, passion IS natural and when it is liberated, outstanding results soon follow. The business world today is so thoroughly global, you need ideas and inspiration from vast global experience. Omar Khan and Sensei International are world-class in helping leaders and teams emotionally engage each other, releasing productive passion and focusing it for powerful results. If you want to upgrade your leadership and uplift your team, this is the book to show you how. Ron Kaufman Author, UP Your Service! Chairman, UP Your Service! College Omar Khan and Paul B. Brown bring clarity and focus to the issue that many businesses overlook--people. Any business without its people would cease to exist. Time and again, I have seen otherwise great leaders brought down by poor leadership development skills. Here Omar draws on his experience in engaging leaders and teams across the world and in collaboration with the ever insightful Paul Brown distills the essence of the real value behind great teams, great talent and great leadership. In an otherwise abstract genre, they bring transformative and skillfully applicable ideas straight into the executive and management suite. Sam Moon CEO, DNMstrategies Limited Managing Director, Asia Pacific, BusinessWeek Events The tools described in this timely book create powerful impact for global teams. You'll read here about fostering appropriate intimacy and emotional maturity through removing unhelpful defensiveness, about the creative capacity of dialogues conducted in a World Cafe format, of brave conversations, of creating \"bold courageous steps\" to bring strategy vividly to life, and to giving future-based requests to each other that simultaneously affirm and challenge our potential as leaders. I heartily recommend that you not only read about these methodologies, but then passionately apply them. You'll be very glad you did! Shonaid Jemmett-Page Global Senior Vice-President, Home and Personal Care, Finance and Information Unilever People and organizations can be dramatically transformed by authentic conversations, a true sense of common purpose and community and removing the \"masks\" that hide real feelings and beliefs. If the leader can show the courage to liberate the suppressed passion of his team and unleash the often hidden energy, it can deliver incredibly powerful results. It is only through genuine engagement with all stakeholders that this process can start. Removing the \"passion killers\" is a great beginning. I hope that reading Liberating Passion will be a catalyst for many of you to move your teams from first into fifth gear. Fred Combe Managing Director, NATUS",
